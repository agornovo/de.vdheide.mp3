Version 0.4

FIX: Changed Eclipse project settings to use the JUnit library instead of JUNIT_HOME
MOD: Various internal modifications (removing of unused private members, imports etc.)
MOD: Added serialVersionUID to all exception classes
MOD: MP3TestCase: delete mp3 files created in setUp in tearDown
FIX: Parser.parseText(int) destroyed last char in a little-endian UTF-16 string
FIX: ID3v2: an InputStream that was passed to the constructor was closed. Only close
     an "internal" InputStream created when a File is passed to the constructor.

Version 0.3

FIX: When updating an ID3v2 tag in an MP3 file which already contained an ID3v2
     header with enough space for the new tag, the file was corrupted.
FIX: A file handle was not closed if a file did not contain any ID3v2 tag.
FIX: If a temporary file was used for writing the ID3v2 tag, the temporary file
     was unnecessarily copied to the original file instead of moving it.
MOD: Massive speedup of ID3v2.update() if a temporary file is used.
FIX: Packaging error: The previous bin archive contained single class files
     instead of a jar file.

FIX: Only read track from v1 tag if byte to the left of it is 0
MOD: Small change in the logic of ID3v2.synchronize() to make the code more readable
FIX: ID3v2.update() sometimes failed to update the file if a temporary file had to be used
FIX: When adding ID3v2 frames to a small file, no padding was used even if requested
MOD: Refactored MP3File constructors by moving common code into a separate method
FIX: MP3File.setInternetStationName() wrote to frame ID "TRSO" instead of "TRSN"
